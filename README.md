# Industrial Safety Management System

# Problem statement:
Safety is a major concern in industrial settings like factories, construction sites, and train yards, where workers frequently fail to wear gloves, helmets, and vests, among other necessary protective gear. In particular, when it comes to big or many sites, manual supervision of safety compliance is ineffective, unreliable, and unable to deliver timely alerts. In order to guarantee that workers are wearing protective gear appropriately, this proposal suggests an automatic safety monitoring system that keeps an eye on them all the time. When a violation is found, the system logs the occurrence and tells supervisors right away. It also keeps a record for future use. In order to help management adopt preventative safety measures system also produces thorough reports and graphic summaries that highlight trends over time, common infractions, and overall compliance. Real-time worker monitoring system specifically designed for site conditions and an integrated workflow from detection to alerting and reporting are some of the project's main accomplishments. This system offers a comprehensive monitoring solution that helps safety officers manage compliance effectively, enhance worker protection, and lower the risk of accidents in industrial environments, in contrast to many other solutions that just concentrate on detecting protective gear. Its design is useful, scalable, and appropriate for use in expansive industrial environments.

# Goal:
1. Improve worker safety by ensuring proper use of personal protective equipment in industrial environments.
2. Automate safety monitoring to reduce human effort and minimize supervision errors.
3. Detect safety violations in real time and notify supervisors instantly for quick action.
4. Record and store safety data to maintain a digital log of all detected violations.
5. Generate detailed compliance reports for analysis and decision-making.
6. Design a scalable system that can be deployed across multiple industrial sites.
7. Support proactive safety management through continuous monitoring and data-driven insights.
